### Source Code

```
I am a VB programmer myself and switched lately to c++ and assembly programming.
Yes assembly is really hard to learn but its worth it.
Well what do you need to start visual assembly for windows ?
First of all a compiler. You get the free microsoft MASM32 linker from Hutchs page:
http://www.movsd.com/ ---> MASM32 Download
Its just 3mb big! Welcome to assembly.
The next thing you download is the free 1mb
visual assembly editor. You combine them to 1 powerfull tool. No installation required. Just copy them to your harddrive.
You get the visual assembly here:
http://radasm.visualassembler.com/
Both downloads contain loads and loads of tutorials and snippets and examples source to get you started in windows programming. And once you ve seen a richtexteditor of just 10kb size you will love it.
Please dont flame me for posting this here, i still love vb buts sometimes its just too limited.
Update: I created a fully webtutorial "From VB to Assembler" using Radasm with tons of scrennshots and samples for download.
